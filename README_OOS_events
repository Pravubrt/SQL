You are working with a large dataset of out-of-stock (OOS) events for products across multiple marketplaces.Each record in the dataset represents an OOS event for a specific product (MASTER_ID) in a specific marketplace (MARKETPLACE_ID) on a specific date (OOS_DATE). The combination of (MASTER_ID, MARKETPLACE_ID, OOS_DATE) is always unique. Your task is to identify key OOS event dates for each product and marketplace combination.

 

Steps to identify key OOS events :
Identify the earliest OOS event for each (MASTER_ID, MARKETPLACE_ID).
Recursively find the next OOS event that occurs at least 7 days after the previous event.
Continue this process until no more OOS events meet the condition.
